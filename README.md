# WIFITE Final Project, BootCon!

My final project for UT Austin Cybersecurity bootcamp.

# Goal of the Project 

This project was in a conference-style format. I conducted research, did hands-on analysis with WIFITE, created a presentation, then presented to the other students. 

The primary goal of this project was to delve into cracking WIFI networks.

In researching WIFITE, I began by getting into networking fundamentals, to understand how Wi-Fi networks operate, including aspects like authentication protocols. Afterwards, I researched cryptographic principles related to Wi-Fi security, such as WPA/WPA2 encryption, to grasp the vulnerabilities that WIFITE aims to exploit. My research also involved reviewing security concepts such as brute-force techniques

# First Section 

For the first section of my presentation, I explained what WIFITE is, and gave an in-depth overview of my research methodology. 

# Second Section  

For the second section, I discussed what is needed to get started using WIFITE. I explained how a WIFI adapter/card needs to have the ability to go into Monitor mode, and be able to do packet injection. 

# Third Section 

For the final section, I reviewed the demonstrations in-depth, and the process behind it. Finally, I provided mitigation strategies for these issues. 

# Presentation 

Below is a link to my WIFITE presentation as well as the demonstrations. Feel free to check it out!
